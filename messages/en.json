        "quote": "\"My father, a lifelong salesman, taught me the most important lesson in business: you're never just selling a product or a service. You're building trust. His customers proved this time and again, following him from one company to the next. They bought whatever he was selling simply because they trusted him. That is the legacy of trust this company is built on. We don't chase transactions; we build partnerships worthy of that same loyalty. Because the only victory that matters is a shared one.\"",
