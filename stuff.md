🔹 2. Security & Marketing Wording

❌ Remove all “official sounding” claims:

“ePrivacy Compliant”

“GDPR Compliant” (with checkmark badge)


✅ Replace with safe, flexible wording:

“We use industry-standard 256-bit encryption (AES-256) for data in transit and at rest.”

“Our services are built with privacy-by-design and align with GDPR principles.”

“We follow guidance from the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) and 

the EU ePrivacy Directive.”

“We plan to pursue external certifications (such as SOC 2) in the future.”


✅ Add limitation of liability disclaimer directly in Terms & Privacy:

“While we apply appropriate security measures, no system is completely secure. Use of our services is at your own risk. We are not liable for indirect or consequential damages.”
